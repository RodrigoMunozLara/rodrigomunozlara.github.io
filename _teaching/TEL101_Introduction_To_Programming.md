Students learn the basic control structures of a programming language, the creation of subprograms, the use of data structures to solve more complex problems and the use of mechanisms for the persistent storage of information. Their learning is methodologically related to the resolution of problems through the use of basic sciences, with an emphasis on mathematics, in a way that reinforces abstract concepts through practice in the field of programming. Furthermore, the methodology is aimed at understanding how the concepts linked to their speciality are related. In turn, it integrates the learning of transversal problem-solving and quality commitment skills, as well as the competence in the use of Information Technologies, as a natural element of their training.
