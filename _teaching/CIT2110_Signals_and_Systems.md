Being able to understand, model and design a telecommunications system is essential. These tasks involve modelling different stages of communication. For this purpose, the student needs to know how a computer generates a message and how the message passes through various stages of a transmission system. In this context, this course provides the tools to model analogue or digital signals, modulate them, filter them, and design a system from a systemic point of view.
