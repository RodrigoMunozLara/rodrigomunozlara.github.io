Course Description
======

Despite the urban population density in the 21st century, remote areas still lack access to communication services such as TV, radio, and Internet. These regions often have no wireless coverage through mobile technologies (3G/4G/5G, WiFi, WiMax) and are not reached by wired infrastructure like fibre optics or coaxial cable. In an increasingly connected world, satellite communications offer a solution by enabling internet access, helping to reduce digital illiteracy and promoting the digitalization of rural industries. Additionally, many companies rely on satellite connectivity to monitor critical infrastructure, such as power lines or oil and gas pipelines, using sensors and actuators. Understanding, modelling, and designing satellite communication systems is essential for a future Computer and Telecommunications Engineer. These tasks include knowing the components involved and the services they support. In this context, the course provides the necessary tools to understand information transmission in satellite links, orbital mechanics, and potential telecommunications services.
