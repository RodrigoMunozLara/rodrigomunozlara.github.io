In the 21st century, although cities have the highest population density and access to communication services, there are still rural areas with low coverage, both wireless and wired. In these cases, satellite communications provide access to services such as the Internet, helping to reduce digital illiteracy and promoting digitisation in rural areas. In addition, satellites are key to connecting sensors and actuators in critical infrastructures located in remote places, such as power lines and gas or oil pipelines. For a future Civil Engineer in Computer Science and Telecommunications it is essential to be able to understand, model and design a satellite communications system. This implies knowing the different elements that compose it and the variety of services that can be implemented on this technology. In this context, this course provides the tools necessary to understand the transmission of information in satellite links, their orbital mechanics and the possible telecommunications services.
