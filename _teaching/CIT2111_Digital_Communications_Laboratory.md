Being able to understand, model and design a telecommunications system is essential. These tasks involve modelling different stages of communication. For this purpose, the student needs to understand the operation of the transmission of digital data over a physical medium that is subject to bandwidth restrictions or is noisy. In this context, this course provides the necessary tools for the digital transmission of information and for treating errors resulting from sending data over a non-ideal physical medium.
