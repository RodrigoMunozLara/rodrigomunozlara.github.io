At the IEEE 10th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT 2025), held in Ottawa, Canada, I presented the talk "SCHC Over DTS-IoT: Performance of SCHC Confirmation Modes in Satellite IoT". This work explores the integration of Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) with Delay-Tolerant Satellite IoT (DTS-IoT) architectures. The presentation focused on evaluating the performance of different SCHC confirmation modes—No-ACK, ACK-on-Error, and ACK-Always—over satellite links with intermittent connectivity and high latency. We discussed the trade-offs between reliability, delay, and energy consumption, supported by simulation and testbed results. The findings offer valuable insights for designing efficient and robust LPWAN protocols in LEO satellite-based IoT deployments.
