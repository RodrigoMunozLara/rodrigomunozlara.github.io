In this poster, I evaluated the performance of SCHC confirmation modes in Direct-to-Satellite IoT (DtS-IoT) using LoRaWAN. Through numerical modeling, we compared No-ACK, ACK-on-Error, and Compound ACK under various packet error rates. Results show that Compound ACK consistently offers the lowest transmission time and latency. The study also considers satellite visibility (Swarm constellation) and compares LoRa and LR-FHSS modulations, highlighting LoRa Data Rate 5 as the most efficient. This work supports the use of SCHC for IP-based communication in satellite LPWANs without terrestrial gateways.
